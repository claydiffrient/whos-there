Who's There?
===================

A semi configurable way to track attendance of members in meetings.


## Development

The app is broken into 3 semi-unique pieces.

### API

The API is in flux right now.  It's likely to be an attempt at an Horizon app.

### Web App

The web app is to be a React + Redux application.

To get started you need to make sure you have Node installed then it's as simple
as:

```bash
cd ./app/web/
npm install
```

To launch it in development mode (making sure you are in the `app/web` directory:

```bash

npm start
```

This will launch a Webpack development server complete with hot module replacement
and live reloading at http://localhost:8080
